    <p>Kali NetHunter has been undergoing a ton of changes as of late. Now supporting over 50 devices and running on Android devices from KitKat (v4.4) to Pie (v9.0), its amazing the extra capabilities that have been introduced.

            But, we don’t want to stop there. After a ton of work, we are really excited to introduce the Kali NetHunter App Store!</p>

    <del><b>Welcome to our second release of 2019</b></del>    
    <u>Kali Linux is constantly evolving with new features being added to the distribution all the time. In an ongoing effort, we are attempting to document common, new, or interesting features available in Kali Linux as best as we can. This has prompted the setup of our Official Kali Linux Documentation website. We believe the fastest way to get to know Kali Linux is to follow the documentation site and explore the new features available.</u>
    <i>The documentation site is in a constant state of work in progress and is translated by Kali Linux community members in their free time, on a best-effort basis. As such, translated documents may fall behind the original English translations. If in doubt of accuracy, know that the English versions are the most up-to-date. If you would like to help with translations, contact us.</i>

        <p>ACE (Automated Corporate Enumerator) is a simple yet powerful VoIP Corporate Directory enumeration tool that mimics the behavior of an IP Phone in order to download the name and extension entries that a given phone can display on its screen interface. In the same way that the “corporate directory” feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from “VoIP Hopper” to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools.</p>
